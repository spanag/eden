    "# LEMS extension: `<WritableRequirement>`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NeuroML formulation, a neuron may be influenced by external mechanisms (such as synapses and input sources) that inject it with current (or chemical substances, when using pure LEMS or EDEN's [Multiflux extension]( extension_multiflux.ipynb )).  The neuron receives inward flows as *aggregates* for each chemical species of interest, and its state is influenced by every aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there exist neuron models where a synapse may *instantly* and *non-linearly* alter a neuron's internal state, in a way that changes the effect of other synapses (for example, fast saturation effects).  EDEN allows such types of instant synpse-to-neuron effects through the `<WritableRequirement>` extension to [LEMS]( intro_lems.ipynb#The-\"components\"-of-a-ComponentType ) `<ComponentType>` dynamics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: At the moment, this feature is only supported for synapses attached to point neurons.\n"

    "## The `<WritableRequirement>` tag\n",
    "\n",
    "`<WritableRequirement>` tags look much like `<Requirement>`s, with required `name` and `dimension` attributes.  The difference is that they can also be *assigned* values from the mechanism requiring them â€” even though they exist in another!\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning a value to a `<WritableRequirement>` is done with a `<StateAssignment>`; where the `variable` name typically refers to a `<StateVariable>` of the same mechanism, a `<WritableRequirement>` of another mechanism's quantity may be used instead."
