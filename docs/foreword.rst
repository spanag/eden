**EDEN** (*E*\ xtensible *D*\ ynamics *E*\ ngine for *N*\ etworks) is a simulation program for `spiking neural networks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network>`_ that takes models described in `NeuroML <https://docs.neuroml.org/>`_ and generates the simulated behaviour of these networks.

..  LATER rate based?

It is best used as part of a neural modelling workflow, between the stage of *generating* the model to simulate, and *analysis* of the simulation's results.
	
To learn how to use EDEN, check out the `Quickstart <quickstart.ipynb>`_ with a classic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron, and browse the `user's guide <user_guide.rst>`__ for more about modelling and usage (starting with :doc:`intro_neuroml`).

.. and the tutorials and our showcase of full-featured models with publication-ready figures.
