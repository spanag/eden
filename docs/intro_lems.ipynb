    "# Extending NeuroML with LEMS components\n",
    "\n",
    "[NeuroML]( https://neuroml.org ) is a rich language for describing neural models.  However, the mechanisms in its standard library are not that extensive and to be fair, it would not be possible to anticipate all the possible mechanisms that could be proposed in neuroscience.  Hence, NeuroML works together with another modelling language, [LEMS]( https://lems.github.io/LEMS/ ).  LEMS can describe arbitrary dynamical equations for mechanisms (arbitrary as in, any [ODE]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation )'s plus instantaneous changes).  In a sense, it is similar to the *[block]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxJpaKuQGo ) [diagram]( https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-988-system-dynamics-self-study-fall-1998-spring-1999/1ba2bda320cfc48c71d04cb2cf42409b_building.pdf )* models seen in, e.g. [MathWorks Simulink™]( https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/block-diagram.html ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within NeuroML, LEMS may be used to describe new types of cells, synapses and much more (see below for the [full list]( #Overview-of-LEMS-mechanisms )). \n",
    "\n",
    "This article will introduce *LEMS components*, and how these can be used to create custom neural dynamics. The various NeuroML-related aspects of LEMS components are presented, and then an example is given on how to write custom dynamics for each sort of neural mechanism (neuron, synapse, &c.)"

    "## What is a LEMS component?\n",
    "\n",
    "A LEMS component is a virtual physical entity (or *mechanism*) that interacts with its environment in ways described my mathematical expressions.  Its internal *state* is captured by a number of scalar *variables*, and its interactions with the environment are in terms of *scalar* physical quantities or instantaneous *events* that it *is affected by* or *determines*.  It may also include other physical quantities called *parameters* that remain fixed throughout a simulation, but still influence the state's dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: The scalar quantities can be used to implement *continuous in space* (also known as \"density-type\") mechanisms,  since all models are discretised to run on the computer; refer to the guide's article on [spatially detailed cells]( intro_spatial.ipynb ), and also the [examples]( gallery.rst ) about modelling fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within its *Requirements* (what comes *in*) and the *Exposures* (what comes *out*), a LEMS component behaves like a *[black box]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box )*; this means that it does not otherwise interact with its surroundings.  This property is helpful to keep track of [what goes where]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns ) in complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary for a LEMS component to have state variables: a stateless component can determine and `expose` quantities that are a function of the component's `Requirement`s at each point in time.  This the case for instantaneous ion channel gates, gap junctions and other \"static\" mechanisms, where the e.g. electrical `conductance` is an important *parameter*.\n",
    "\n",
    "LEMS components are added to NeuroML files just like NeuroML-standard mechanisms.  A [tag]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#Tag ) named after their *type* is added inside the `<neuroml>` but not inside the `<network>`, and the tag's [attributes]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#Attribute ) specify the *parameters* that determine its behaviour.  Indeed, the NeuroML-standard mechanisms we've used in the [previous]( intro_lems.ipynb ) [articles]( intro_spatial.ipynb ) also have [LEMS descriptions]( https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/tree/master/NeuroML2CoreTypes ). \n",
    "\n",
    "What remains then, is to describe the *types* of the components."

    "## What is a LEMS `ComponentType`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides `<Component>`, the other core concept of LEMS is `<ComponentType>`.  This describes the *external interface* and the *internal structure* of components, and the *mathematical expressions* that govern their behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their usefulness comes from the frequent occasion where many types of mechanism can be captured by the same mathematical equations.  A famous case is the [*Izhikevich neuron model*]( https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.pdf ) where the same equations capture many and much different neural activity patterns: all that changes is the values of some parameters.  By describing a `ComponentType` we can thus specify the essential dynamics once, instead of re-defining all the properties and behaviour for each *component instance*.  `ComponentTypes` are also very useful when archiving or exchanging NeuroML models, since every user (or use case) may require a different set of parameters for the same general model type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the ComponentType is defined *once* and then specialised, *concrete* components are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<ComponentType name=\"MyNewSynapseType\">\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    <Dynamics>\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    </Dynamics>\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "</ComponentType>\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "<MyNewSynapseType this_parameter=\"60 ms\" that_parameter=\"37 degC\">\n",
    "\n",
    "    or, equivalently:\n",
    "    \n",
    "<Component type=\"MyNewSynapseType\" \n",
    "    this_parameter=\"60 ms\" that_parameter=\"37 degC\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the components can indeed be further replicated, as in the case of multiple `<connection>`s in a `<projection>`, or `<input>`s in an `<inputList>`.  In case that individual instances need to have different parameters within the same `<inputList>` or `<projection>`, this type of variability can be specified through EDEN's [\\<CustomSetup\\>]( extension_customsetup.ipynb ) extension. \n",

    "### The \"components\" of a ComponentType\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a reference of the LEMS properties that can be used to make NeuroML mechanisms (as far as EDEN is concerned).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attribute `name`; that's used to refer to the `ComponentType` and hence must be unique for each.\n",
    "* Attribute `extends`; This specifies the `ComponentType` as a ['derived']( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming) ) type that *inherits* properties from another, more abstract `ComponentType`.  This way it's not necessary to re-write the whole `ComponentType` from scratch. Refer to the [NeuroML reference]( https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Cells.html ) (check sidebar) for the standard LEMS components, and the NML component list [below]( #Overview-of-LEMS-mechanisms ) for a per-type analysis.  \n",
    "    **Note**: Components should `extend` a relevant base type of neuron, synapse, etc. to be considered by EDEN for said roles.\n",
    "* Attribute `description`; that's optional and up to taste.  It is better than XML comments for explaining what the `ComponentType` does or represents.  Note that the other LEMS tags may also accept a `description` attribute as well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* *Interface* tags:\n",
    "    * `<Requirement>`: This is a *quantity* that the component *needs* from its surroundings, to determine its own behaviour.  For example, an ion channel may open or close depending on membrane potential.  \n",
    "        * Attributes are the `name` identifier (which mush match with an available `<Exposure>`), and the `dimension` (in the [sense used in Physics]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(physics) )) of said quantity. \n",
    "    * `<Exposure>`: This is a *quantity* that the component *determines* based on its requirements and internal state.  Information about this quantity may be thus *exposed* to related parts of the model.  For example, an ion channel may *determine* and *expose* the electrical current flux through it.\n",
    "        * Attributes are the `name` identifier (which must match with the `<Requirement>`s that dependent components have) and the `dimension` of the exposed quantity.\n",
    "    * `<EventPort>`: This is a named \"port\" (or \"letter box\" for lack of a better word) that components can receive the *occurrence* of discrete events through, or alternatively *emit* discrete events In a sense, it is similar to a `<Requirement>` or `<Exposure>` for discrete events rather than quantities over time.  For example, a post-synapse waits for the firing of the pre-synaptic neuron that's a discrete event, and a (site of a) neuron may announce when a \"spike\" has happened on it.  \n",
    "    Attributes are the `name` identifier, and the `direction` which can be either `in` (the port *receives* events) or `out` (the port *sends* events). \n",
    "* *Static attributes* tags:\n",
    "    * `<Parameter>`: This is a quantity about the component, that remains the same for the *component* throughout the simulation.  Its value must be specified as a [XML attribute]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#Attribute ) in every declared `<Component>` of this `<ComponentType>`.  For example, different neurons may have different `<Parameter>` values, but the values stay the same for each cell.  \n",
    "    Attributes are `name` and `dimension`.\n",
    "    * `<Property>`: This is same as the `<Parameter>` tag, *except* there can also be a `defaultValue` attribute that is used *if* the value is not specified in a declared `<Component>`.  For example, the `weight` of synapses and input sources is `1` unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "    * `<Constant>`: This is a quantity that's just immutable.  Its value is specific to the `<ComponentType>`; it may not be defined for each instance separately.  They are typically used for natural constants such as `π`, or units that are used in math expressions.  But they can also be used to reduce the *memory footprint* of the component, so that more of them can fit in the computer during simulation.\n",
    "    Attributes are `name`, `dimension`, and mandatory `value`.\n",
