    "It is often the case that biophysical properties *vary spatially* across the spatial extent of a neuron.  NeuroML has a provision for modelling the variability of the base conductance( $\\bar g$ ) of ion channel distributions, as a user-specified function of distance from the soma (measured along neurites).  Still, modellers may desire more types of variability, and on different parameters as well.\n",
    "This article shows how Eden's [<𝙲𝚞𝚜𝚝𝚘𝚖𝚂𝚎𝚝𝚞𝚙>]( extension_customsetup.ipynb ) extension can be used to model any kind of variability, on any attribute of a mechanism present on [spatially-detailed cells]( intro_spatial.ipynb ).\n",
