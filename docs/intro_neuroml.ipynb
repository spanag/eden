Of course, these stimuli are normally provided by *adjacent neurons*, which motivates us to model those neurons as well as well as the stimuli that these neurons receive...  At some point we end up out of scope and/or technical resources, and will have to replace external neuron input with a rougher *abstraction*.\n",

    "We will add two different *graded synaptic component* types from the NeuroML library: an [ohmic]( http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neuronal_cable_theory#Electrical_Synapses ) [&lt;gapJunction&gt;]( https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Synapses.html#gapjunction ) model, and a dummy [&lt;silentSynapse&gt;]( https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Synapses.html#silentsynapse ) model that applies no effect (for one-way interactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we'll define the synapse types inside the `<neuroml>` and outside the `<network>`, but this time we'll different `projection` tags to state that unlike the previous 'classical' synapses, these are *bi-directional continuous connections*.\n",
    "The new tags used are `<electricalProjection>` for symmetric connections and `<continuousProjection>` for not necessarily symmetric connections.\n",
    "These contain different tags, `<electricalConnectionInstance>` and `<continuousConnectionInstance>` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference with `<projection>` and `<connection>` is that the `synapse` is not an attribute of the `projection` but individually specified for each connection instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<electricalConnectionInstance>`s have a `synapse` type parameter.  This `synapse` gets instantiated twice, once for *each* side of the connection, and the two hlaves are symmetrically attached to the (only nominally) `pre` and `post` synaptic sites.\n",
    "* `<continuousConnectionInstance>`s have two different `synapse` type parameters, `preComponent` and `postComponent`.  In this case, the `pre` component may be different from the `post` component, each is instantiated and attached on its respective side of the synapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "So then, the tags are slightly different from the classic-type `<connection>` and the `{pre,post}synapticComponent`s are specified individually for each synapse, that's because the style changed during the development of NeuroML.  EDEN may be rather permissive on mixing and matching from either style.  Just remember that you may have to use a slightly differently style for action and graded potentials when making your NeuroML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to specify weight, `<electricalConnectionInstance>` and `<continuousConnectionInstance>` can be replaced with the similar `<electricalConnectionInstanceW>` and `<continuousConnectionInstanceW>` tags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* There also are two equivalent but a little bit shorter tags `<electricalConnection>` and `<continuousConnection>`; but tags like `<electricalConnectionW>` and `<continuousConnectionW>` are *not* in the standard and will be just *ignored* by EDEN, watch out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these *continuous* connections can't have a `delay` associated with them, though that would help make [neural mass models]( http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/TheVirtualBrain#Modeling_Approach ).  If you are interested in continuous interactions *with* pure lag, do state your requirements in a [feature request for NeuroML]( https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title= )."

Or (when using EDEN) we could just roll all model parts side by side with the `<Simulation>` in a *single file* if that's more convenient.
