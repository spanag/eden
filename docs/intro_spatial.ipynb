    "The \"[NeuroML basics]( intro_neuroml.ipynb )\" article introduced the NeuroML framework and data format for expressing spiking neural networks.  In the process, it explained how simplified neuron models, such as LIF and Izhikevich types, can be specified, parameterised and used to construct networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These simplified models are also often called *abstract cells* or  *point neurons*, because they reduce the detailed anatomy and biophysical specificity found in nature, into just a few *scalar values* that produce a (roughly) equivalent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also another, more \"direct\" approach to simulate biophysics, by taking into account the spatial extent of the neuron and the immediate electro-chemical reactions that are supposed to take place slong it.  The \"spatial\" or \"physically-based\" formulation is thus composed of the *shape* (called *morphology* in neuro-anatomy) of the neuron, and the biophysical mechanisms that are present across the morphology.  Under this formulation, most *cell-internal* biophysics properties (such as ion channels, concentration models, and physical membrane and cytosol properties) are modelled as being *finely distributed* over spans of neurite; whereas points of *interaction with* the neuron such as synapses and input probes are modelled as non-spatial (\"point\") processes that are located at a specific spot on the neuron.\n",

    "**Aside**: Once the biophysical effects are captured and quantified well enough through in-vitro and/or in-silico experiments, these effects can be added back to simplified neuron models: the aim is to preserve the effect while simplifying the dynamics equantions and their computational requirements.  These *improved* simplified neurons can be expressed in NeuroML with the help of LEMS, as shown in the [relevant article]( intro_lems.ipynb )."

This tag must \"contain\" two other tags: a `<morphology>` tag that describes the *shape* of the neuron type, and a `<biophysicalProperties>` tag that describes the biophysics going on throughout the shape of the cell.  Each of these tags will be explained in *adequate* depth in the following sections.\n",

In this case, the `<cell>` tag may, instead of containing a `<morphology>` or `<biophysicalProperties>` tag inside it,  have a `morphology` or `biophysicalProperties` *attribute* that names the stand-alone tag with associated `id`.\n",
