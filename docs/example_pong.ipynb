Within these environments, if an actor is not yet capable of behaving, it may *learn* to behave through interaction and some gentle prodding to the right direction.  This process is called *[reinforcement learning]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning )*.\n",

To simplify math, we'll be using the *half* width (`hw`) and height(`hh`) as measures, and take (0,0) as the coordinates of the field's middle. This is where we'll serve the balls from as well. (A variant is serving from a paddle, which would give more time to the players to react.)\n",

    "\n",
    "For illustration purposes (and since setting a SNN to competently control the ball appears *tricky* even when any living creature could manage), we'll implement the players as *proportional control* governors which chase after where the ball is now.  Keep in mind that the effective command is capped in the playing field, to simulate real-life constraints.  And because that would be too perfect, we'll introduce *noise* (simulating \"tremor\" and general uncertainty) that perturbates the control enough to make it interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have implemented all this inside one LEMS component, but were we'll break it down since we want our own non-trivial system (a *spiking neural network* perhaps?) to work the paddles.  The playing field (or *environment*) is separated from the *controller*, with the only communication flows being observation (in whichever form) and control command (in whichever form).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is then, the *proportional control* rule expressed in LEMS.  Note that the same `<ComponentType>` can be used for both players.  \n",
    "**Note**: Even though the component is static (the paddle's command force is simply [where it isn't minus where it is]( https://web.archive.org/web/20030813200740/http://www.afmissileers.org/AFMissileers/pdf/NL1997/Dec97.pdf#page=5 )), we continuously assign a `StateVariable` with an always-holding `<OnCondition>` so that the `<VariableRequirement>` can observe it."
